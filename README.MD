# Python Data visualization with Dash

Dash is a productive Python framework for building web analytic applications.

Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom
user interfaces in pure Python. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python.
